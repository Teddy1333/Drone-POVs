The goal of the project is to have a flight drone simulator created. 
A large model, made in Blender, has been uploaded, along with working exports in FBX and STL formats. 
Unreal Engine 4.27 is being used for the development. 
The simulator is designed to allow a flight plan with waypoints (3D coordinates) to be set in a virtual environment upon launch. 
The ability to switch views to one of three available drones has been implemented, both at the start and during the flight. 
Each drone is made to follow a specified flight plan and can also be controlled via joystick.
